/// - **Step 2** (`m(stem) > 0`): the long suffix-family table (`-ational`->
///   `-ate`, `-tional`->`-tion`, `-enci`->`-ence`, ... `-biliti`->`-ble`).
/// - **Step 3** (`m(stem) > 0`): `-icate`->`-ic`, `-ative`-> (delete),
///   `-alize`->`-al`, `-iciti`->`-ic`, `-ical`->`-ic`, `-ful`/`-ness`->
///   (delete).
/// - **Step 4** (`m(stem) > 1`): removes `-al`, `-ance`, `-ence`, `-er`,
///   `-ic`, `-able`, `-ible`, `-ant`, `-ement`, `-ment`, `-ent`, `-ion` (only
///   if preceded by `s`/`t`), `-ou`, `-ism`, `-ate`, `-iti`, `-ous`, `-ive`,
///   `-ize`.
/// - **Step 5a**: trailing `e` deleted if `m(stem) > 1`, or if `m(stem) == 1`
